# Integrated Analytics with Azure Synapse

This project is a step-by-step guide to exploring data analytics with Azure Synapse Analytics. The project covers ingesting data into the Azure Synapse workspace, analyzing the data using SQL pool and Spark pool, and visualizing the results in chart view.


## Prerequisites
Before starting the project, make sure you have access to the following services:

+ Azure Synapse Analytics
+ Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account
+ Azure subscription with admin-level access


## Getting Started

To get started, provision an Azure Synapse Analytics Workspace resource in the Azure subscription. Follow the instructions in the **Problem Statement 1** to ingest the data into the synapse and then query the uploaded data using SQL pool.

***Source Dataset:***

Next, follow the instructions in the **Problem Statement 2** to fix the issue with the result and update the query by selecting the category and count as ProductNumbers.

Finally, follow the instructions in the **Problem Statement 3** to analyze the data using the Spark pool.


## Problem Statements

The project is divided into three problem statements, each of which builds upon the previous one:

1. Explore Data Analytics Workspace using Azure Synapse Analytics
2. Analyze and query the data using SQL pool
3. Analyze the data using Spark pool

Follow the instructions in each problem statement to complete the tasks and achieve the project goal.

## Validation Use Cases
The following use cases should be met to validate the completion of the project:

+ Azure Synapse workspace has been created.
+ Ingested the data choosing HTTP.
+ SQL pool has been used to analyze the data.
+ Spark pool is used to analyze the data.
+ Code Snippet is added to both the pool for analyzing the data.
+ Discard all the changes and delete the resources.

## Conclusion
This project provides an overview of how to use Azure Synapse Analytics for Integrated Data Analytics in the Azure subscription. By following the step-by-step instructions, you can learn how to ingest data into the synapse, analyze the data using SQL pool and Spark pool, and visualize the results in chart view.
